angular-image-crop
==================

I'm attempting to make a self-contained AngularJS Directive which will allow you to crop an image before it's uploaded to the server.


* Touch support, swipe to move and double-touch gesture to zoom  - IN PROGRESS
* Add any image file from your device/machine
* Output as a base64-encoded data uri
* Uses HTML5 Canvas

Note: this is currently a work in progress, and will be 'modularized' with all of the above features when it's complete!

## Step 1. Choose image
